            "<p style='font-size: 22px;'>Accessibility to education in Hong Kong is a pressing issue, particularly for students from low-income families and marginalized communities. Many face barriers such as high tuition fees, the cost of private tutoring, and limited access to quality schools. Overcrowded classrooms in public institutions further hinder personalized learning and support. Additionally, students with special needs often struggle to find appropriate resources and inclusive environments. The competitive academic landscape leaves many children at a disadvantage, perpetuating cycles of inequality. Experts emphasize the need for policies that promote equitable access to education, ensuring that all children can pursue their academic goals without financial or social barriers.</p>",
